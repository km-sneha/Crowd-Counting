## 📌 About the Project
Crowd Counting is a deep learning-based project that estimates the number of people in an image or video. This model is particularly useful for surveillance, traffic monitoring, and event management.

---

## 🎯 Features
✅ **People detection in dense crowds**  
✅ **Supports both images and video inputs**  
✅ **Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**  
✅ **Pretrained model support for high accuracy**  
✅ **Real-time visualization of predictions**

## 🛠️ Installation

Ensure you have Python installed, then follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/km-sneha/Crowd-Counting.git
cd Crowd-Counting

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

Run the project using:

```bash
# For image-based crowd counting
python main.py --image path/to/image.jpg

# For video-based crowd counting
python main.py --video path/to/video.mp4
```

> **Note:** Adjust parameters in `config.py` for customization.

## 📌 Example Output

```
🔍 Loading model...
📸 Processing image...
👥 Estimated crowd count: 123
✅ Completed!
```

---

## 🏗️ Model Training

If you wish to train the model from scratch:

```bash
python train.py --dataset path/to/dataset
```

Ensure you have a properly labeled dataset for accurate training.
